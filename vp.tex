\title{ {\bf  Coercion-free Universally-verifiable Voting over the Web} }

\begin{abstract}
  We support  coercion-free
  and universally-verfiable voting for lay users over the world-wide-web.
  Established cryptographic and systems
  security primitives are adapted and enhanced in order to
  achieve these objectives. 
  Our voter security model differs from prior research in that it delays and
  defers
  the ascertainment of voter legitimacy to a human poll manager.
  This eliminates the requirement of an identity infrastructure,
  thereby making it possible
  for lay users to run cryptographically secure polls on demand.
