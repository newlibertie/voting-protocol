Need to review and attach in related work:

Seems to be exact.  choose first threshold to be 100 say
less than 100 voters, no result.  and then choose next threshold 1.
any authority can determine total.
need to go through http://www.lsv.fr/Software/spore/schnorr.pdf ,
in order to be able to get the zero knowledge proof of the vote
being one or the other
